# Bike Vendors Project

There are different models from each bike vendor. These bike models are categorized based on its usage,frame, price and mode. The objective of this project is to analyze this bike vendor dataset to generate any insights on price variation of different models across different locations. The visualization tools will be used to develop correlation among the different parameters accordingly.


## Getting Started

Download the bikevendors.cvs file into your local machine. Then load this dataset into Rstudio.

### Prerequisites

For this project, the R-studio application should be available and the dataset file should be downloaded into the folder. 


## About the dataset

There are bike models, category1, category2, frame type, and price parameters. These are provided for 25 bike vendors. 

## Deployment

Required libraries will be installed and made available for data visualization
